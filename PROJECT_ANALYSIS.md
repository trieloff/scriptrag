**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Current Version**: 44% Complete (per vibe-coded badge)

## Current State Summary

### Completed Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Project Setup ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Core Components ✅
3. **Phase 3**: LLM Integration ✅
4. **Phase 4**: GraphRAG Implementation ✅
5. **Phase 6**: Search and Query Interface ✅
6. **Phase 7**: API and Interface (7.1, 7.2, 7.3 complete) ✅
7. **Phase 8**: Pluggable Mentors System (Save the Cat mentor complete) ✅

### In Progress/Incomplete Phases

1. **Phase 5**: Scene Management Features
   - 5.1 Scene Ordering - Not started
   - 5.2 Scene Operations - Partially implemented

2. **Phase 8**: Additional Mentors (deferred)
   - Hero's Journey mentor
   - Three-Act structure mentor
   - Character Arc analysis mentor

3. **Phase 9**: Testing and Optimization
   - Need comprehensive test coverage for newer features
   - Performance optimization pending

4. **Phase 10**: Documentation and Deployment - Not started

5. **Phase 11**: Script Bible and Continuity - PR #44 open

6. **Phase 12**: Advanced Features - Future work

## Key Metrics

- **Source Files**: 53 Python files
- **Test Files**: 2,423 test files
- **Recent Activity**: 15+ merged PRs, 13,000+ lines added
- **Open PRs**: 1 (PR #44 - Phase 11 implementation)
- **Open Issues**: 1 (Issue #46 - Modernize Python tooling)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Phase 5 - Scene Management

- Implement scene ordering system (5.1)
- Complete scene operations (5.2)
- Critical for screenplay editing workflows

### Priority 2: Expand Test Coverage

- Integration tests for GraphRAG pipeline
- MCP server comprehensive testing
- Mentor system test coverage

### Priority 3: Modernize Tooling (Issue #46)

- Update Python packaging to latest standards
- Improve CI/CD pipeline
- Enhanced developer experience

### Priority 4: Additional Mentors

- Hero's Journey implementation
- Three-Act structure analyzer
- Character Arc tracker

### Priority 5: Documentation

- API documentation updates
- User guides for new features
- Architecture documentation

## Technical Debt

1. Scene operations need full implementation beyond basic CRUD
2. Test coverage gaps in newer features
3. Python tooling could use modernization
4. Documentation needs updates for recent features

## Strengths

1. Solid foundation with GraphRAG implementation
2. Comprehensive MCP server with 16 tools
3. Successful mentor system architecture
4. Good security practices (UUID usage, path validation)
5. Active development with frequent commits

## Conclusion

ScriptRAG is progressing well with strong architectural decisions and implementation quality. The immediate focus should be on completing the scene management features (Phase 5) which will unlock important screenplay editing capabilities. The project maintains high code quality standards with extensive pre-commit hooks and would benefit from continued test coverage expansion.
