- **PR #468**: Cleaned up artifacts and optimized package versions

**Dependencies:**

- **PR #477**: Updated mkdocs-material to 9.6.19
- **PR #476**: Updated hypothesis to 6.138.15

**Documentation:**

- **PR #474**: Added weekly status reporting (previous week)

#### Closed Without Merge (4 PRs)

- PR #484: Scene heading normalization - needs reassessment
- PR #483: LLM response sanitization - alternative approach needed
- PR #478: Resource leak prevention - superseded by PR #475
- PR #486: Initial status report - being replaced with this accurate version

### Key Improvements

1. **Database Reliability**: Critical fixes to connection management ensure that readonly operations properly reset state and release connections, preventing database locks.

2. **Test Stability**: Removed problematic test fixtures that were causing intermittent failures. Tests now run more reliably across different environments.

3. **Code Modernization**: Removed legacy code and deprecated aliases, improving maintainability.

4. **Resource Management**: Fixed thread daemon status to prevent resource leaks during shutdown.

## Technical Focus Areas

### Fountain Parsing & Scene Management

- Scene validation now handles edge cases gracefully
- Proper handling of empty or missing content
- Maintains screenplay integrity without modifying creative content

### Database Layer

- SQLite with vector support for semantic search
- Graph database patterns for character relationships
- Reliable connection pooling and transaction management

### Privacy & Local-First Design

- All processing happens locally
- No external services required for core functionality
- Scripts remain under writer's complete control

## Project Philosophy Adherence

This week's work maintained strict adherence to ScriptRAG's core principles:

âœ… **Respecting Writer Autonomy**: All changes focused on analysis capabilities, never modifying creative content
âœ… **Local-First**: No cloud dependencies introduced
âœ… **Open Standards**: Continued focus on Fountain format support
âœ… **Privacy**: No telemetry or external data transmission

## Issues & Blockers

- **No open issues**: All reported issues have been addressed
- **No critical bugs**: System is stable for screenplay analysis workflows

## Next Week Focus

1. **Fountain Format Enhancements**: Continue improving parser robustness for edge cases
2. **Character Analysis**: Enhance character relationship extraction
3. **Scene Graph**: Improve scene-to-scene connectivity analysis
4. **Documentation**: Update user guides with recent improvements

## For Writers Using ScriptRAG

Recent improvements mean:

- More reliable script indexing and analysis
- Better handling of unconventional formatting (respecting creative choices)
- Improved stability when working with large scripts
- Faster test suite for contributors
