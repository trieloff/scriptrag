# Claude Code Review Workflow
#
# This workflow runs Claude Code review on pull requests with two trigger mechanisms:
# 1. Automatically when a new PR is opened (immediate feedback)
# 2. After all CI checks pass (via workflow_run trigger)
#
# This ensures Claude reviews are:
# - Provided early for new PRs
# - Only run on green builds to avoid reviewing broken code
# - Not triggered on every push (reducing noise)
