# AI-Aligned Git Verification

## Verification Status: ✅ PASSED

Verified on: 2025-07-31

### Test Results

1. **Symlink exists**: `/usr/local/bin/git → /root/.local/bin/git` ✅
2. **Correct git in use**: `which git` returns `/usr/local/bin/git` ✅  
3. **AI wrapper installed**: Git wrapper script with AI detection logic present ✅
4. **PATH order correct**: `/usr/local/bin` comes before `/usr/bin` in PATH ✅
5. **Command resolution**: Git from `/usr/local/bin` takes precedence ✅
6. **AI attribution functional**: Test commit showed proper Claude Code attribution ✅

### Summary

The AI-aligned-git wrapper is successfully installed and functioning. All git commands are properly routed through the AI detection wrapper, which correctly attributes commits made by AI tools to "Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>" with appropriate co-authorship.

No manual fixes required - setup is working as intended.
