- **55-89 points**: Epic-level work (major system overhauls, new subsystems)

**Factors Considered:**

- **Complexity**: Technical difficulty and architectural impact
- **Risk**: Potential for breaking changes or production impact
- **Effort**: Developer hours required (not calendar time)
- **Testing**: Test coverage requirements and validation complexity
- **Dependencies**: Impact on other systems or teams
