# AI Agent Guidelines for ScriptRAG

This document contains guidelines and rules for AI agents working on the ScriptRAG project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency and adds character to our development process.

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

### Rule 1: Semantic Commits with Movie Quotes

All commit messages MUST follow the semantic-commit format AND include a fitting, memorable movie quote that relates to the change being made.

#### Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

"<movie quote>" - <character>, <movie> (<year>)
```

#### Semantic Commit Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

#### Examples

```text
feat(parser): add fountain screenplay parser integration

Integrated the fountain parser library to handle screenplay format parsing.
This enables the system to read and understand standard fountain files.

"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads." - Doc Brown, Back to the Future (1985)

```

```text

ordering algorithms.

"I'll be back." - The Terminator, The Terminator (1984)
```

#### Movie Quote Selection Guidelines

1. **Relevance**: The quote should relate to the nature of the change:
   - Bug fixes: Use quotes about problems, mistakes, or solutions
   - Features: Use quotes about creation, innovation, or new beginnings
   - Refactoring: Use quotes about transformation or improvement
   - Documentation: Use quotes about communication or understanding

2. **Memorability**: Choose quotes that are widely recognized and memorable

3. **Appropriateness**: Keep quotes professional and workplace-appropriate

4. **Variety**: Try to use quotes from different genres and eras of cinema

5. **Context**: For a screenwriting tool, film quotes are particularly fitting

#### Great Quote Sources by Commit Type

**For Fixes:**

## üé¨ Why Movie Quotes?

ScriptRAG is a screenwriting assistant, making movie quotes a natural fit for our commit messages. They add personality to our git history while maintaining the semantic commit format's clarity and usefulness. Plus, they make reviewing git logs more enjoyable!

## üìö Future Guidelines

This document will be expanded with additional guidelines as the project evolves. Check back regularly for updates.
