ScriptRAG is a novel screenwriting tool that combines Fountain parsing, graph databases, and local LLMs
to create an intelligent screenplay assistant using the GraphRAG (Graph + Retrieval-Augmented
Generation) pattern.

## Features

- **Fountain Parser**: Read and parse screenplays in Fountain format
- **Graph Database**: SQLite-based lightweight graph database for screenplay structure
- **Local LLM Integration**: Uses LMStudio for text generation and embeddings
- **Advanced Search**: Find shows, seasons, episodes, scenes, characters, locations, concepts, objects,
  and temporal points
- **Scene Management**: Order scenes by script order, temporal order, or logical dependencies
- **Scene Editing**: Update, delete, or inject new scenes while maintaining screenplay integrity
- **Script Bible Support**: Comprehensive continuity management with character development tracking,
  world-building documentation, timeline management, and cross-episode consistency validation

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python with uv package manager
- **Database**: SQLite as a graph database
- **LLM**: Local LLMs via LMStudio (OpenAI-compatible API at <http://localhost:1234/v1>)
- **Parser**: Fountain screenplay format parser
- **Pattern**: GraphRAG (Graph + Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Interface**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI assistant integration

### Quick Start

```python
from scriptrag import ScriptRAG

# Initialize ScriptRAG
srag = ScriptRAG(
    llm_endpoint="http://localhost:1234/v1",
    db_path="./screenplay.db"
)

# Parse a screenplay
script = srag.parse_fountain("path/to/screenplay.fountain")

# Search for scenes with a character
scenes = srag.search_scenes(character="PROTAGONIST")

# Update a scene
srag.update_scene(
    scene_id=123,
    new_location="INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY"
)
```

### Using the MCP Server

```bash
# Start the MCP server
scriptrag-mcp serve --config mcp_config.json

# The MCP server will be available for AI assistants
# Example MCP tool usage from an AI assistant:
# - scriptrag.parse_script(path="screenplay.fountain")
# - scriptrag.search_scenes(character="PROTAGONIST", location="COFFEE SHOP")
# - scriptrag.analyze_timeline(episode_id=1)
# - scriptrag.get_character_graph(character="PROTAGONIST")
```
