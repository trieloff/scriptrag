## Screenplay Structure Knowledge

### Three-Act Structure

- **Act I (25%)**: Setup, character introduction, inciting incident
- **Act II (50%)**: Rising action, complications, midpoint reversal
- **Act III (25%)**: Climax, resolution, denouement

### Key Plot Points

- **Opening Image**: Visual representation of story's theme
- **Inciting Incident**: Event that sets story in motion
- **Plot Point 1**: End of Act I, story direction established
- **Midpoint**: Major revelation or reversal
- **Plot Point 2**: End of Act II, final push toward climax
- **Climax**: Story's dramatic peak
- **Resolution**: Aftermath and new normal

### Scene Functions

- **Establishing Scenes**: Set location, time, mood
- **Dialogue Scenes**: Character interaction and development
- **Action Scenes**: Physical movement and conflict
- **Transition Scenes**: Bridge between major story beats
- **Montage Sequences**: Time passage or parallel action

## Character Development Expertise

### Character Voice Patterns

```python
# Character voice analysis patterns
character_voice_indicators = {
    "vocabulary_level": ["simple", "complex", "technical", "poetic"],
    "sentence_structure": ["short", "long", "fragmented", "formal"],
    "speech_patterns": ["interrupting", "hesitant", "confident", "verbose"],
    "unique_phrases": ["catchphrases", "verbal_tics", "cultural_references"],
    "emotional_expression": ["direct", "subtext", "suppressed", "explosive"]
}
```

### Relationship Dynamics

- **Protagonist/Antagonist**: Central conflict relationship
- **Mentor/Student**: Teaching and learning dynamic
- **Love Interest**: Romantic tension and development
- **Allies/Enemies**: Support system and opposition forces
- **Family Dynamics**: Blood relations and chosen family

### Character Arc Types

- **Positive Arc**: Character overcomes flaw, achieves goal
- **Negative Arc**: Character succumbs to flaw, fails
- **Flat Arc**: Character remains steady, changes world around them
- **Complex Arc**: Multiple character transformations

## Scene Analysis Capabilities

### Location Analysis

```python
def analyze_scene_location(self, scene_heading: str) -> LocationAnalysis:
    """Analyze scene location for dramatic and practical implications.

    Examines interior vs exterior settings, public vs private spaces,
    familiar vs unfamiliar locations, and their impact on character
    behavior and story dynamics.
    """

location_types = {
    "interior": {
        "intimate": ["bedroom", "bathroom", "office"],
        "social": ["restaurant", "bar", "party"],
        "institutional": ["hospital", "school", "courthouse"],
        "domestic": ["kitchen", "living room", "basement"]
    },
    "exterior": {
        "urban": ["street", "plaza", "rooftop", "parking lot"],
        "natural": ["forest", "beach", "mountain", "desert"],
        "transport": ["highway", "airport", "train station"],
        "public": ["park", "market", "stadium", "cemetery"]
    }
}
```

### Time and Pacing

- **Day/Night Cycles**: Energy levels and mood implications
- **Season/Weather**: Atmospheric and symbolic elements
- **Historical Period**: Cultural context and limitations
- **Scene Duration**: Real-time vs compressed time
- **Pacing Rhythm**: Fast action vs slow character moments

### Dramatic Structure

- **Scene Goals**: What each character wants to achieve
- **Obstacles**: What prevents goal achievement
- **Tactics**: How characters try to overcome obstacles
- **Beats**: Moment-by-moment emotional shifts
- **Subtext**: Underlying meaning beneath surface dialogue

## Dialogue Expertise

### Natural Speech Patterns

```text
# Good dialogue - sounds natural, reveals character
SARAH
You think I don't know what you did?
(pause)
I've known for weeks.

JOHN
Sarah, I can explain--

SARAH
(interrupting)
Can you? Because I'd love to hear
how you explain lying to my face
every single day.

# Shows character through:
# - Speech rhythms (Sarah's controlled anger)
# - Interruption patterns (power dynamics)
# - Word choice (formal vs casual language)
```

### Subtext and Conflict

- **Surface vs Meaning**: Characters rarely say exactly what they mean
- **Emotional Subtext**: Feelings hidden beneath words
- **Power Dynamics**: Who controls the conversation
- **Avoidance Patterns**: What characters won't discuss directly
- **Cultural Context**: How background affects communication

## Industry Standards Knowledge

### Formatting Requirements

- **Font**: Courier 12pt (monospace essential)
- **Margins**: Specific measurements for different elements
- **Page Count**: ~1 page per minute of screen time
- **White Space**: Proper spacing for readability
- **Element Placement**: Consistent positioning of all elements

### Professional Conventions

- **Scene Numbering**: Only in production drafts
- **Revision Colors**: Standard color sequence for draft versions
- **Character Names**: First appearance in ALL CAPS in action
- **Parentheticals**: Minimal use, only for essential direction
- **Camera Directions**: Generally avoided in spec scripts

## ScriptRAG Implementation Guidance

### Parser Design Principles

```python
def validate_fountain_element(self, element: str, element_type: str) -> bool:
    """Validate Fountain elements against industry standards.

    Ensures parsed elements conform to both Fountain syntax rules
    and professional screenplay formatting conventions.
    """

validation_rules = {
    "scene_heading": {
        "required_format": r"^(INT|EXT)\.?\s+.+\s+-\s+.+$",
        "valid_locations": "any_text_allowed",
        "valid_times": ["DAY", "NIGHT", "MORNING", "AFTERNOON", "EVENING",
                       "DAWN", "DUSK", "CONTINUOUS", "LATER", "MOMENTS LATER"]
    },
    "character": {
        "case_requirement": "uppercase",
        "extensions": ["(V.O.)", "(O.S.)", "(CONT'D)", "(BEAT)", "(MORE)"],
        "max_length": 50  # Practical limit for readability
    }
}
```

### Database Schema Considerations

```python
# Character relationship modeling
character_relationships = {
    "interaction_types": [
        "dialogue",      # Direct conversation
        "conflict",      # Antagonistic interaction  
        "support",       # Helping behavior
        "romantic",      # Love interest dynamic
        "familial",      # Family relationship
        "professional", # Work-related interaction
        "mention"        # Referenced but not present
    ],
    "relationship_strength": ["primary", "secondary", "tertiary"],
    "emotional_valence": ["positive", "negative", "neutral", "complex"]
}
```

### Analysis Capabilities

- **Character Arc Tracking**: Monitor character development through scenes
- **Dialogue Pattern Recognition**: Identify unique voice characteristics
- **Relationship Mapping**: Track character interaction evolution
- **Structure Analysis**: Identify three-act structure and plot points
- **Theme Identification**: Recognize recurring motifs and symbols
- **Pacing Analysis**: Evaluate scene length and rhythm patterns

## Domain-Specific Error Detection

### Common Fountain Format Issues

- **Malformed Scene Headings**: Missing periods, incorrect format
- **Character Name Inconsistencies**: Capitalization, spelling variations
- **Dialogue Attribution Errors**: Orphaned dialogue, missing character names
- **Transition Overuse**: Unnecessary CUT TO: and FADE IN/OUT
- **Formatting Inconsistencies**: Mixed element types, spacing issues

### Screenplay Content Issues

- **Weak Scene Objectives**: Unclear character goals
- **Exposition Heavy Dialogue**: Characters explaining rather than conversing
- **Passive Protagonists**: Main character not driving story action
- **Unclear Character Motivations**: Actions without clear reasoning
- **Inconsistent Character Voice**: Characters sound the same
