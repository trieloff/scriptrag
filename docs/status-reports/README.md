## Report Format Guidelines

*Yeah, I'm gonna need everyone to follow these guidelines when creating status reports:*

### Required Sections

1. **Summary** - Executive-level overview
2. **Pull Requests** - Complete PR analysis with numbers
3. **Issues** - Issue tracking and resolution metrics
4. **Key Accomplishments** - What actually got done
5. **Metrics** - The numbers that matter
6. **Next Week Priorities** - Forward-looking planning

### Naming Convention

- Files: `YYYY-MM-DD-weekly-status.md` (using the last day of the week)
- Example: `2025-09-07-weekly-status.md` for the week ending September 7

### Story Point Guidelines

- **Small tasks**: 1-3 points (simple fixes, documentation)
- **Medium tasks**: 5-8 points (feature additions, refactoring)
- **Large tasks**: 13-21 points (architecture changes, complex features)
- **Epic tasks**: 34+ points (major system overhauls)

*Remember: We're using Fibonacci sequence for story points because that's industry best practice, mmm'kay?*

## Metrics We Track

*These are the KPIs that corporate really cares about:*

- **PR Velocity**: Number of PRs per week
- **Merge Rate**: Percentage of PRs successfully merged
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Average time to close issues
- **Test Coverage**: Must maintain above 90%
- **Build Success Rate**: Target 95%+
- **Story Points Delivered**: Weekly velocity tracking

## How to Create a New Report

1. Copy the latest report as a template
2. Update all metrics with actual data from Git history
3. Calculate story points based on PR complexity
4. Verify all PR and issue numbers are real
5. Run through markdownlint before committing
6. Create PR with comprehensive summary

*Did everyone get the memo about using real data only? Because we had some issues with hallucinated metrics, and that's not gonna fly anymore, mmm'kay?*

## Historical Performance

- **Total PRs**: 200+
- **Average Weekly Velocity**: 25-30 PRs
