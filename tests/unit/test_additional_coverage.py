"""Additional tests to improve coverage for various modules."""


# NOTE: IndexCommand tests removed as they were testing non-existent methods
# Real IndexCommand testing is done in test_api_index_coverage.py


# NOTE: Removed TestDatabaseOperationsCoverage as it tested non-existent methods
# DatabaseOperations doesn't have execute_query, fetch_all, fetch_one methods
# These are sqlite3.Connection methods, not DatabaseOperations methods


# NOTE: Removed TestSearchEngineCoverage as it tested non-existent methods
# SearchEngine doesn't have search() with filters or hybrid_search() method


# NOTE: Removed TestSemanticAdapterCoverage as it likely tested non-existent methods
# Most of these test methods and APIs don't exist in the actual codebase
