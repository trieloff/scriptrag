## Themes

- Small elite vs. vast population; rule by logistics, not terror
- Faith and policy tension: Arian/Nicene coexistence under constraint
- Sea as lifeline; bread, ships, law as statecraft
- Disappearance by absorption rather than annihilation

## Visual/Texture Notes

- Carthage: white-plastered walls, blue-ochre markets, sailcloth shadows
- Maritime soundscape: caulking hammers, gulls, creaking cordage
- Mixed tongues: Latin, Gothic, Greek, Berber loanwords
