INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The shop is bustling with activity. People sip coffee and work on laptops.

SARAH (30s, focused) sits at a corner table with her laptop.

SARAH
I need more coffee if I'm going to finish this screenplay.

She waves to the BARISTA.

BARISTA
Coming right up!

The barista brings over a fresh cup of coffee.

SARAH
(grateful)
You're a lifesaver.

She takes a sip and gets back to work.

FADE OUT.
