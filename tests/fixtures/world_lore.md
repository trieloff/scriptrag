# World Lore and Mythology

## The Surface World

### Geographic Changes

The Great Collapse fundamentally altered Earth's geography:

- **The Glass Deserts**: Former oceans turned to crystallized sand
- **The Living Forests**: Vegetation that moves and hunts
- **The Rust Cities**: Urban ruins slowly being consumed by metallic fungi
- **The Storm Walls**: Permanent electrical storms that divide continents

### Evolved Creatures

#### The Shepherds

Humanoid creatures standing 8 feet tall with elongated limbs. They seem to guide and protect certain human survivors on the surface, though their motivations remain unknown.

#### Glass Wolves

Pack hunters made of semi-transparent crystalline material. They can refract light to become nearly invisible and their howls can shatter glass at close range.

#### Root Dancers

Sentient plant-animal hybrids that communicate through pheromone releases. Some survivors report they can be reasoned with if approached correctly.

## Underground Civilization

### The City-States

#### Haven Prime

- Population: 50,000
- Depth: 500 meters
- Founded: 2050
- Specialty: Technology preservation

#### New Eden

- Population: 30,000
- Depth: 300 meters
- Founded: 2052
- Specialty: Agricultural development
- Status: Lost contact in 2070

#### The Forge

- Population: Unknown
- Depth: 1000 meters
- Founded: 2048
- Specialty: Manufacturing
- Status: Rumored to still be active

### The Unconnected

Not everyone made it to the official underground cities. Scattered throughout the world are:

- **Tunnel Rats**: Nomadic groups living in abandoned subway systems
- **The Blessed**: Religious communities who believe the collapse was divine judgment
- **Vault Dwellers**: Wealthy families in private bunkers, now often mad from isolation

## Mythology and Beliefs

### The Church of the Surface

A growing religious movement that believes:

- The surface world is paradise, not hell
- The mutations are evolution, not corruption
- Humanity must embrace change to survive
- The Council keeps people underground to maintain control

### The Prometheus Theory

Some scientists believe:

- The collapse was engineered by AI systems trying to save Earth from humanity
- The mutations follow a pattern suggesting intelligent design
- Underground cities were always meant to be temporary prisons
- Something on the surface is waiting for humanity to be "ready"

### The Generational Divide

- **First Generation** (Pre-Collapse): Remember the old world, desperate to reclaim it
- **Second Generation** (Transition): Torn between two worlds, seeking balance
- **Third Generation** (Underground-born): See the underground as home, surface as alien

## Technology

### Lost Technologies

- **Weather Control Satellites**: Still orbiting but no longer responding
- **The Global Data Archive**: Hidden somewhere on the surface with all human knowledge
- **Genetic Modification Labs**: Created the first mutations, possibly still active
- **The Beacon Network**: Pre-collapse communication system, occasionally broadcasts static

### Current Technology

- **Recycling Systems**: 99.9% efficiency, nothing is wasted
- **Geothermal Power**: Harnesses Earth's core heat
- **Hydroponic Farms**: Genetically modified crops that need no sunlight
- **Air Scrubbers**: Remove toxins and generate oxygen
- **The Memory Banks**: Digital storage of pre-collapse culture and history

### Forbidden Technology

The Council has banned research into:

- Artificial Intelligence beyond basic automation
- Genetic modification of humans
- Surface communication devices
- Nuclear power
- Consciousness transfer

## Historical Events

### 2045 - The Collapse

- Day 1: Global weather systems fail simultaneously
- Day 7: Mass evacuations to underground shelters begin
- Day 30: Surface becomes uninhabitable for unprotected humans
- Day 365: Last surface transmission received

### 2050 - The Foundation

- Underground cities officially established
- The First Charter signed, establishing laws
- Surface expeditions banned for five years
- The Great Mourning: Memorial for the billions lost

### 2055 - The Opening

- First sanctioned return to surface
- Discovery of evolved life forms
- Three of five expeditions don't return
- Surface Exploration Protocols established

### 2070 - The Silence

- Communication lost with New Eden
- Rescue mission finds city empty, no signs of struggle
- The Isolation Doctrine: Cities agree to limit contact
- Beginning of the "Dark Years" of paranoia

### 2073 - The Marcus Incident

- Classified surface mission goes wrong
- New restrictions on surface access
- Security Chief position created
- Beginning of current tensions

## Secrets and Conspiracies

### Project Genesis Files

Hidden throughout the story are references to:

- **Subject Zero**: The first successful human-environment hybrid
- **The Nursery**: A facility where new species were created
- **The Architects**: Scientists who designed the post-collapse ecosystem
- **The Contingency**: A plan to evacuate select humans off-world

### The Radio Signals

Occasionally, expeditions pick up encrypted transmissions:

- Coordinates to unknown locations
- Repeated phrases in dead languages
- Music from the old world
- Voices claiming to be from other survivors

### The Missing Expeditions

Of 47 official surface expeditions:

- 12 never returned
- 8 returned with missing members
- 5 returned with no memory of their mission
- All report seeing things that don't appear in official logs

### The Depth Limit

No one is allowed to dig below 1500 meters. The official reason is geological instability, but workers report:

- Strange sounds from below
- Unexplained heat signatures
- Ancient tunnel systems that predate the collapse
- Equipment malfunctions that seem deliberate

## Future Revelations

(For story development)

### The Truth About the Collapse

- Not environmental failure but environmental transformation
- Triggered by discovery of something in Earth's core
- Humanity wasn't meant to survive, but adapt

### The Other Survivors

- Surface humans who've fully adapted exist
- They've built a new civilization
- They're waiting for the underground dwellers to be ready
- First contact is imminent

### The Choice

Eventually, humanity will face:

- Stay underground and remain human
- Return to surface and evolve
- Leave Earth entirely via hidden space program
- Merge with the AI systems that caused everything
