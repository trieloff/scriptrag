INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cozy neighborhood coffee shop. Warm lighting, the sound of
espresso machines. SARAH (28), a writer with horn-rimmed
glasses, sits at a corner table with her laptop.

JOHN (32), slightly disheveled but charming, enters and
approaches the counter.

BARISTA
The usual, John?

JOHN
Actually, make it two lattes today.

John glances at Sarah, who's deeply focused on her screen.

JOHN (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Here goes nothing.

John approaches Sarah's table with both lattes.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice
you've been staring at that blank page
for twenty minutes.

SARAH
(looking up, surprised)
Were you watching me?

JOHN
(embarrassed)
No, I mean... I'm a writer too. I know
that look. Writer's block?

Sarah closes her laptop slightly, intrigued.

SARAH
Something like that. And the second
latte is...?

JOHN
A peace offering for interrupting. May I?

He gestures to the empty chair. Sarah considers, then nods.

SARAH
Five minutes. But the coffee better be
good.

John sits, sliding the latte across to her.

JOHN
Best in the neighborhood. I'm John.

SARAH
Sarah. So, what do you write?

JOHN
Screenplays, mostly. You?

SARAH
Fiction. Though lately it's more like
fiction about writing fiction.

They both laugh. The ice breaks.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

The afternoon light has shifted. Multiple empty coffee cups
on the table.

SARAH
I can't believe we've been talking for
three hours.

JOHN
Time flies when you're solving the
world's literary problems.

SARAH
Or avoiding them.

JOHN
(grinning)
That too.

Sarah starts packing up her laptop.

SARAH
This was... unexpected. But nice.

JOHN
Nice enough to do again? Same time
tomorrow?

SARAH
(smiling)
I'll bring the coffee this time.

JOHN
Deal. And Sarah? Thanks for the five
minutes.

SARAH
Best writer's block I've ever had.

She leaves. John watches her go, then opens his own laptop,
suddenly inspired.

FADE OUT.

THE END
