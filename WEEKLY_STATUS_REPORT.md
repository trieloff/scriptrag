- ‚úÖ **Analysis, Not Judgment**: All features provide objective data
- ‚úÖ **Local-First**: Enhanced offline capabilities and performance
- ‚úÖ **Quality Focus**: Comprehensive testing prevents regressions

**Compliance Check**: All 16 commits this week were reviewed against [TO-NEVER-DO.md](TO-NEVER-DO.md) - zero violations detected.

## üìù Management Notes

**Resource Allocation**: Optimal this week. Team focused on infrastructure stability rather than new features - exactly the right priority for this phase of the project.

**Technical Debt**: Actually decreased this week thanks to comprehensive test additions and bug fixes. We're in good shape, mmm'kay?

**Stakeholder Communication**: All changes align with user feedback about reliability and performance. Corporate should be pleased with our quality metrics.
