### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scriptrag.git
cd scriptrag

# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start

```python
from scriptrag import ScriptRAG

# Initialize ScriptRAG
srag = ScriptRAG(
    llm_endpoint="http://localhost:1234/v1",
    db_path="./screenplay.db"
)

# Parse a screenplay
script = srag.parse_fountain("path/to/screenplay.fountain")

# Generate embeddings for semantic search
await srag.process_script_embeddings(script.id)

# Search for scenes with a character
scenes = srag.search_scenes(character="PROTAGONIST")

# Semantic search for similar scenes
similar_scenes = await srag.search_similar_scenes(
    query="emotional confrontation between friends",
    limit=5
)

# Update a scene
srag.update_scene(
    scene_id=123,
    new_location="INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY"
)
```

### Command Line Examples

```bash
# Parse and build knowledge graph from a screenplay
scriptrag parse examples/data/sample_screenplay.fountain

# Search for dialogue containing specific text
scriptrag search dialogue "I love you"

# Find scenes with specific characters
scriptrag search character "PROTAGONIST" "ANTAGONIST"

# Semantic search for thematically similar content
scriptrag search semantic "betrayal and revenge"

# List all characters and their relationships
scriptrag graph characters

# Analyze temporal structure of the screenplay
scriptrag analyze timeline
```

### Bulk Import Examples

```bash
# Import entire TV series from a directory structure
scriptrag script import "Breaking Bad/**/*.fountain"

# Import with custom season/episode pattern
scriptrag script import "*.fountain" \
    --pattern "S(?P<season>\d+)E(?P<episode>\d+)"

# Preview import without actually importing (dry run)
scriptrag script import "Season*/*.fountain" --dry-run

# Import from directory with automatic series detection
scriptrag script import ./scripts/

# Import with series name override
scriptrag script import "episodes/*.fountain" \
    --series-name "My TV Show"

# Control import behavior
scriptrag script import "*.fountain" \
    --skip-existing \      # Skip files already in database
    --batch-size 20        # Process 20 files per batch
```

The bulk import feature automatically:

- Detects TV series patterns in filenames (e.g., S01E01, 1x01, Episode 101)
- Extracts season and episode numbers
- Groups episodes by series and seasons
- Creates proper database relationships
- Handles special episodes and multi-part episodes
- Supports custom regex patterns for non-standard naming
