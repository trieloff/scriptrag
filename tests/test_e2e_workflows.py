INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A dimly lit warehouse. ALEX (30s, skilled thief) studies blueprints spread
across a dusty table.

MAYA (20s, tech expert) types rapidly on her laptop, multiple screens glowing.

MAYA
The security system resets every 3 hours. We have a 5-minute window.

ALEX
(focused)
That's all we need.

MARCUS (40s, getaway driver) enters, car keys jingling.

MARCUS
Vehicle's ready. Are we doing this?

Alex and Maya exchange determined looks.

ALEX
Tonight, we take back what's ours.

EXT. CORPORATE BUILDING - NIGHT

The team approaches a gleaming office tower. Security cameras sweep the perimeter.

MAYA
(whispering into earpiece)
Jamming their signals... now.

The cameras freeze. Alex moves swiftly to the service entrance.

INT. CORPORATE BUILDING - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Alex navigates through dark hallways, Maya's voice guiding through the earpiece.

MAYA (V.O.)
Left at the junction. Elevator's disabled. Take the stairs.

INT. CORPORATE BUILDING - SERVER ROOM - NIGHT

Alex reaches the server room. Maya's custom device blinks green - access granted.

ALEX
I'm in. Downloading now.

Suddenly, alarms blare. Red lights flash.

MAYA (V.O.)
(urgent)
They've detected us! Get out NOW!

Alex grabs the device and sprints for the exit.

EXT. CORPORATE BUILDING - NIGHT

Marcus's car screeches to a halt. Alex dives in. They speed away as security
floods the building.

INT. MARCUS'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

The team catches their breath. Alex holds up the device - mission complete.

MAYA
Did we get it all?

ALEX
Every last byte.

MARCUS

Just another Tuesday night.

FADE OUT.
