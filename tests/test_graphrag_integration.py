FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A bustling coffee shop filled with the aroma of fresh brew. SARAH (30s,
ambitious journalist) sits at a corner table, typing furiously on her laptop.

JOHN (40s, mysterious stranger) enters, scanning the room. His eyes lock onto Sarah.

JOHN
(approaching cautiously)
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

SARAH
(without looking up)
Yes, by my deadline.

JOHN
(smiling)
I have information about the Whitmore case.

Sarah's fingers freeze over the keyboard. She looks up, intrigued.

SARAH
How did you know I was working on that?

JOHN
Let's just say we have mutual interests.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

John and Sarah sit across from each other, coffee cups between them. The
conversation has grown intense.

SARAH
You're asking me to trust you with no credentials, no proof.

JOHN
Sometimes the best sources are the ones who can't reveal themselves.

Sarah studies him carefully, weighing her options.

SARAH
(finally)
What do you know about the missing documents?

JOHN
Everything. But first, we need to establish ground rules.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING

The sun sets as John and Sarah exit the coffee shop together. The city
bustles around them.

SARAH
This better not be a waste of my time.

JOHN
Trust me, by tomorrow morning, you'll have your front-page story.

They part ways, each walking in opposite directions into the city twilight.

FADE OUT.

THE END"""
