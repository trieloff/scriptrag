INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A dimly lit office. DETECTIVE MILLER (45, weathered) sits behind a cluttered desk covered with case files and photographs. A half-empty whiskey bottle and glass sit nearby.

He picks up his revolver, checks the cylinder, and places it in his shoulder holster. His badge gleams under the desk lamp.

DETECTIVE MILLER
(into phone)
Yeah, I got the photos. The murder weapon was definitely a knife.

He hangs up the old rotary phone and lights a cigarette with his silver lighter.

The door opens. SARAH (30s) enters carrying a leather briefcase.

SARAH
I brought the money. Fifty thousand in cash, as promised.

She opens the briefcase revealing stacks of hundred dollar bills.

DETECTIVE MILLER
And the documents?

Sarah pulls out a manila envelope from her coat.

SARAH
Everything's here. Bank records, surveillance footage on this usb drive.
(hands him the drive)
And your plane ticket to Mexico.

Miller takes a swig from his whiskey glass, then puts on his fedora hat and trench coat.

DETECTIVE MILLER
(checking his watch)
We need to go. Take the car keys.

He tosses her his car keys and grabs the briefcase.

EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Rain pours down. Miller and Sarah run to a vintage Mustang. Sarah gets in the driver's seat while Miller loads the briefcase in the trunk next to a shotgun and a first aid kit.

INT. MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

Sarah starts the engine. The radio plays jazz. Miller checks his cellphone - three missed calls.

SARAH
(nervous)
What about the paintings in the safe?

DETECTIVE MILLER
Leave them. We only need the diamonds.

He pulls out a small velvet pouch from his pocket, revealing several diamonds.

SARAH
And the security cameras?

DETECTIVE MILLER
Disabled them with my laptop.
(shows her a laptop)
Wiped everything.

Sarah accelerates, tires screeching. In the rearview mirror, police lights flash.

DETECTIVE MILLER (CONT'D)
(grabbing shotgun)
Floor it!

FADE OUT.
