INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

ALICE enters the bustling coffee shop.

ALICE
(cheerfully)
Good morning, Bob!

BOB
(smiling)
Hey Alice! The usual?

ALICE nods and sits down.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

They walk through the quiet park.

ALICE
(thoughtfully)
It's so peaceful here at night.

BOB
Yeah, quite different from the morning rush.
