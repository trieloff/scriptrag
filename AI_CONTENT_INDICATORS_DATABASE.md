## Notes and Observations

### Key Takeaways

1. **"Delve" is the single most reliable indicator** of AI-generated content
2. **Em dashes**, while controversial, remain a strong signal

10. **Tricolon structure** and groups of three for emphasis

### Important Caveats

- These patterns are not definitive proof of AI authorship
- Human writers may naturally use these phrases
- Detection methods are imperfect and evolving
- Cultural and linguistic backgrounds affect writing patterns
- Professional writers legitimately use many of these elements

### Future Considerations

- AI models are continuously evolving
