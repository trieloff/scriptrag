# File Size Limits Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Established File Size Limits

- **Regular Python files**: 1000 lines (soft warning), 1500 lines (hard error)
- **Test files**: 2000 lines (hard error)
- These limits ensure MCP tools can effectively read and process files within token constraints

### 2. Created Enforcement Mechanism

- **Script**: `scripts/check_file_size.py` - Checks Python files against size limits
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Added to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for automatic enforcement
- **Features**:
  - Provides clear warnings for soft limit violations
  - Blocks commits for hard limit violations
  - Suggests refactoring strategies

### 3. Updated Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md**: Added comprehensive file size limits section with:
  - Rationale for limits (MCP token constraints)
  - Current violations list
  - Refactoring guidance
- **docs/refactoring-guide.md**: Detailed guide for refactoring large files

### 4. Demonstrated Refactoring Pattern

Created example CLI package structure showing how to split `cli.py`:

```text
src/scriptrag/cli/
├── __init__.py      # Package exports
├── main.py          # Main app entry point
├── config.py        # Config commands (extracted)
└── [other command groups...]
```

## Current Violations to Address

| File | Lines | Suggested Action |
|------|-------|------------------|
| `cli.py` | 3313 | Split into command groups (8 modules) |
| `mcp_server.py` | 3346 | Extract tool implementations |
| `character_arc.py` | 2538 | Split mentor logic by phase |
| `operations.py` | 1967 | Separate by operation type |
| `migrations.py` | 1896 | Consider versioned migration files |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Hard Limit Violations)

1. **Refactor `cli.py`** (highest priority - most over limit)
   - Extract each command group to separate module
   - Keep common utilities in `main.py`
   - Update all imports

2. **Refactor `mcp_server.py`**
   - Create `mcp/tools/` subdirectory
   - Split tools by category
   - Keep server setup in main module

3. **Refactor `character_arc.py`**
   - Split by analysis phases
   - Keep base analyzer separate

### Medium Priority (Approaching Limits)

- Address files between 1000-1500 lines
- Monitor file growth in active development areas

### Long-term Maintenance

- Pre-commit hooks prevent new violations
- Regular review of files approaching soft limit
- Refactor proactively when adding features

## Benefits Achieved

1. **MCP Tool Compatibility**: Files remain within token processing limits
2. **Better Code Organization**: Logical separation of concerns
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused modules
4. **Improved Developer Experience**: Easier to navigate and understand
5. **Automated Enforcement**: Pre-commit hooks maintain standards

## Testing Considerations

After any refactoring:

```bash
make test          # Run full test suite
make lint          # Check code style
make type-check    # Verify type annotations
```

The file size limits are now actively enforced, helping maintain a sustainable and MCP-compatible codebase!
