INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

The office is cluttered with case files. DETECTIVE JONES (40s) sits at his desk,
examining a revolver. His badge gleams on the desk next to a half-empty
bottle of whiskey.

JONES
(to himself)
This gun... it's the key to everything.

He puts the revolver in his leather holster and picks up his fedora hat.

INT. CRIME SCENE - LATER

JONES enters the crime scene. The same revolver from his office is now in an
evidence bag on a table. He pulls out his magnifying glass to examine it closer.

A FORENSICS TECH hands him a manila envelope containing photographs.

FORENSICS TECH
The gun matches the one from the Miller case.

JONES nods, putting the photos back in the envelope. He notices a coffee mug
on the counter - the same distinctive blue mug from his office.

JONES
Someone's trying to frame me.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

JONES sits across from a SUSPECT. The revolver sits in the evidence bag between them.
JONES' badge is on the table. He pulls out a cigarette and lighter.

SUSPECT
That's not my gun. I've never seen it before.

JONES slides the photographs across the table. The same manila envelope from
earlier sits nearby.

JONES
Then explain these photos.

The SUSPECT nervously taps his fingers on the metal table. A two-way mirror
reflects their tense faces.

FADE OUT.
